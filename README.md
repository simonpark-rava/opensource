# RAVA's OPENSOURCE PROJECT

#### Rava's opensource network invites developers to contribute ideas and code. The original code was written by our software team at RAVA, led by our Program Development Manager and Statistician, Oliver Ellison, MSSD. RAVA, the Research Association for Veteran Advocacy, is a non-profit organization whose primary mission is to study measurable data trends that effect our US military veterans; including such data points as legal issues and outcomes, social inequities, marriage and divorce rates, financial variables including unemployment and homelessness, as well as disease and death.  

#### Improving our methods for data analysis provides us a better understanding of these ongoing patterns of correlation and helps us argue in favor of reforms to healthcare, justice, social programs and aide.  Since we are a nonprofit organization, we are happy to share these powerful tools with others who may benefit from these cutting-edge methods to use raw data.  Feel free to contribute to our repository or use any part of the opensource versions of RAVA software for your own data analysis or mobile data visualization projects. 

*Enjoy!*
